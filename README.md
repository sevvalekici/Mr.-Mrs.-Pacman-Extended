The main purpose of the game for both single and multiplayer modes is to collect all the food on the map and to stay alive by keeping away of the ghosts. Once all the food collected player(s) gets awarded and manage to play the next level. 
  Single player game mode is pretty much the same the standard Pac-Man arcade game. However, player has the power to create its own game map which player has the ability to determine the number of ghosts to dodge (enemies), amount of the food etc. Player can design its own map by using lines, corner and brick pieces on Map Lab section of the game. With the awards player can buy shields which protect the character from ghosts at different levels. Also there are two special food types. First one, provides the ability to pass by the ghost without any injury for five seconds. Other one provides passing through walls for five seconds.
In multiplayer game mode, both players use the same keyboard, while one uses arrow keys other one uses W,A,S,D key combination. Both players has the same goal as above. Thus, they will have each others back.
Note: Player can save the current game status and come back to this game, load and play it again.
